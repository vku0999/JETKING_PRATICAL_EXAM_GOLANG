Here is a simple Go program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var num1, num2 float64

	// Taking input from the user
	fmt.Print("Enter first number: ")
	fmt.Scanln(&num1)

	fmt.Print("Enter second number: ")
	fmt.Scanln(&num2)

	// Performing arithmetic operations
	add := num1 + num2
	sub := num1 - num2
	mul := num1 * num2

	// Since division and modulus should be checked for divide-by-zero errors
	if num2 != 0 {
		div := num1 / num2
		mod := int(num1) % int(num2)

		// Printing results
		fmt.Printf("\nAddition: %.2f\n", add)
		fmt.Printf("Subtraction: %.2f\n", sub)
		fmt.Printf("Multiplication: %.2f\n", mul)
		fmt.Printf("Division: %.2f\n", div)
		fmt.Printf("Modulus: %d\n", mod)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Error: Division or Modulus by zero is not allowed.")
	}
}
```

### Explanation:
- The program prompts the user to input two numbers.
- It performs the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
- For division and modulus operations, it checks whether the second number is zero to avoid division-by-zero errors.
- The results are printed with proper formatting.

### Sample Output:
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 3

Addition: 13.00
Subtraction: 7.00
Multiplication: 30.00
Division: 3.33
Modulus: 1
```
